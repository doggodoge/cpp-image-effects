# Cpp Image Effects

In an effort to learn a bit more C++, I decided to write a few image effects. I'm using the [stb_image]() and [stb_image_write]() libraries to load and save images.

This tool applies a few effects to an image. The effects are:

* **Blur** - A simple box blur

and that's it so far. A simple box blur. I'll add more as I learn more and have the time.
